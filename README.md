# DL-with-Python-Chapter-3-NN-examples
This repository includes the example NN models given in Francis Chollet's Deep Learning with Python's Chapter 3(Getting started with Neural Networks). I'm only a newbie to ML and neural networks and there is much I don't know, so your help/advice is much appreciated and welcomed.
